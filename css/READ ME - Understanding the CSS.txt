This CSS is the Cyborg Theme that I have obtained from Bootswatch website. This is not the original css for Bootstrap. Any file in this folder with -def in its name is
the original Css, rename it properly kinda like replacing the file to revert back to original if needed. 

~ Update 1 ~
Most of the files in here are not used, but came with bootstrap, I may delete them later carefully. Most important is the bootstrap.min.css, this is the basic styling
for the cyborg theme, advised not too touch. The mototorsportstylesheet.css is where we add all our styling and css code, so whatever classes and id's you need to 
make please put in that .css file.

If you have questions email me at: umar.qureshi@uoit.net, or 
facebook me or msg me on slack if you know me. Have a nice day :)
